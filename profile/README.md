# Getting Started

If you're looking to get involved in our community on an administration, maintenance, and/or technical capacity, you're in the right place. The first step is to make sure you have [joined GitHub][github.join], which is free. This is where you will be able to contribute to any of the following:

- Mobile, web, and other codebases
- External, user facing documentation and materials
- Internal, developer facing technical documentation
- Discussions and decisions regarding the features and direction of the community

A good starting point could be any of the following:

- Look into our [current Projects][projects], get involved and contribute code to an existing Issue
  - The [Web App Parity Project][projects.web] for more frontend focus and/or an 'easier' transition into the code
  - The [v1.0 Project][projects.1] for more fullstack focus and/or the entire scope of what we are focusing on now
- Look into our [documentation][docs], feel free to make suggestions or ask questions
- See what is going on or start a conversation in the [Discord][discord]
- See what is going on or start a discussion in our [GitHub Discussions][discussions]
  - Note that there are separate Discussion pages for each repository for more specific topics
